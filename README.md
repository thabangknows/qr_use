# qr_use
QR-use, a South African small company owned and managed by two co-partners Ramalepe Thabang and Letselane Izaya. We worked on a number of projects, QR-use is 1 of them.  Our short story  On our final year of studying, we had to present a system we worked on as a project. The link to the system was embedded into a QR Code and we did it a week before, on a certain QR Code generator. When our lecturer scanned the QR Code, he was redirected to the platform’s site. The site wrote ‘the qr code has expired, upgrade to premium to generate permanent qr codes’  That motivated us and we were aslo inspired by how fast the world of technology is moving and having people wanting to own their own QR codes, then we saw the need to invert QR-use.
